                <p>Counting routes is the most error-prone part of scoring in Ticket to Ride. That's why each route length
                    button includes a different sound effect to reduce the chance of error going unnoticed by you or your
                    friends.</p>
                <p>You can easily validate your input after you entered all the routes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Count number of player's cars left on the table <span class="example">(for example 7)</span>.</li>
                    <li>Subtract that number from 45 to calculate the number of cars used <span class="example">(in our example: 45 - 7 = 38)</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Compare "number of cars used" shown in the app to calculated one.</li>
                    <li>If numbers do match, then everything was counted correctly <span class="example">(in our example you should see 38 in the app)</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Note: 45 is the maximum number of cars in the standard game (it might vary if you added more cars or play
                        some kind of nonstandard version).
                    </li>
                </ol>
